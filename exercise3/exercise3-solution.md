## 3. Plotting with matplotlib

#### a. Download the jupyter notebook [customized_plotting.ipynb](customized_plotting.ipynb) and try to understand the individual steps in creating a plot and customizing it

ANS: I managed to run the notebook and understand the steps.

#### b. Produce your own data (curves, images, point clouds, etc...) and create a nice plot. Get inspired by the [matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) and use the extensive documentation of the [pyplot API](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html)

ANS: I have used some data from my research and some methods I made myself to make a colorful plot, saved under 'lucas_nice_plot.pdf'. The notebook that generated it is 'lucas_plotter.ipynb' and the data necessary is inside the 'data' directory.
