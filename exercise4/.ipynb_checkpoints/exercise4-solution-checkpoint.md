## 4. Testing code with py.test

#### a. Install pytest using e.g.
```
pip install pytest --user
```
ANS: Installed. (Apparently it comes installed with Anaconda)

#### b. Write a module ```test_simple_math.py``` which tests the correctness of the math operations inside ```simple_math.py```.
You can run the tests using the ```py.test``` command. Note that the name of your test functions should start with ```test_```.

ANS: Run tests for all functions. The tests are in the file 'test_simple_math.py'. Also added two new functions to the module and tested them: 'factorial' and 'exp'.
